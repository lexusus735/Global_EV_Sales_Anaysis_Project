# Introduction
This project explores the global growth of electric vehicles (EVs) through detailed data analysis from 2010 to 2023. Using data from the [International Energy Agency (IEA)](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-data-explorer), we analyze sales, stock levels, and market shares to understand regional trends and powertrain preferences.
# Background
The global shift toward electric mobility is driven by environmental concerns, government policies, and technological advancements. EV adoption is rising rapidly, but the pace and nature of this transition vary across countries and powertrain types. This analysis aims to uncover key insights from more than a decade of EV market data.
# Key Questions
This study seeks to answer the following core questions:
1. What is the global EV sales trend from 2010 to 2023?
2. How has the distribution of EV sales evolved over time?
3. What are the EV sales patterns in key regions (China, EU27, USA, and World)?
4. How do global EV sales compare among BEV, PHEV, and FCEV powertrains?
5. What are the regional trends of EV sales over time?
6. How has the EV sales share changed over time in different regions?
7.How has the EV stock share evolved across key regions?
8. What is the overall EV sales and stock performance by region?
