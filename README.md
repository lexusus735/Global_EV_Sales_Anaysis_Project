# Introduction
This project explores the global growth of electric vehicles (EVs) through detailed data analysis from 2010 to 2023. Using data from the [International Energy Agency (IEA)](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-data-explorer), we analyze sales, stock levels, and market shares to understand regional trends and powertrain preferences.
# Background
The global shift toward electric mobility is driven by environmental concerns, government policies, and technological advancements. EV adoption is rising rapidly, but the pace and nature of this transition vary across countries and powertrain types. This analysis aims to uncover key insights from more than a decade of EV market data.
# Key Questions
This study seeks to answer the following core questions:
1. What is the global EV sales trend from 2010 to 2023?
3. What are the EV sales patterns in key regions (China, EU27, USA, and World)?
4. How do global EV sales compare among BEV, PHEV, and FCEV powertrains?
5. What are the regional trends of EV sales over time?
6. How has the EV sales share changed over time in different regions?
7.How has the EV stock share evolved across key regions?
8. What is the overall EV sales and stock performance by region?

# Key Learning
- EV sales have seen exponential growth, especially after 2015.
- BEVs lead the global EV market, followed by PHEVs; FCEVs remain marginal.
- China dominates EV sales, with rapid year-over-year increases.
- Europe and the U.S. show steady growth but differ in powertrain preferences.
- Emerging markets like India and South Africa are still in early stages of EV adoption.
- EV sales and stock shares have risen significantly in leading regions, indicating growing market penetration.
# Recommendation
- Governments should continue and expand EV incentives and infrastructure investment, especially in underperforming regions.
- Manufacturers should prioritize BEV development while maintaining strategic offerings in PHEV segments.
- Emerging economies need targeted policies to boost EV adoption, such as subsidies and localized production.
- Further analysis should include charging infrastructure availability, fuel savings, and future scenario modeling (e.g., projections under different policy frameworks).
# Conclusion
This analysis provides a clear view of the global electric vehicle market from 2010 to 2023. The growth of EVs is robust but uneven across regions and powertrains. China, the EU, and the U.S. lead the shift, while other nations are catching up. As EV technology and infrastructure continue to mature, the global automotive landscape is poised for a major transformation.
